	I am Emily Orosco, Cal student and travel enthusiast. I am currently working with two on-campus groups, GlobeMed at Berkeley and FemTech@Berkeley, where I hope to help address health disparities and promote diversity in tech. Follow me as I embark on this journey of self-exploring and procrastination. If you would like to talk to me about any of these or what other trips I plan on taking, just find me in class!

	 I lived in the UK for a few months, specifically London, and because of that I started following two English guys who embody storytelling via traveling. Follow their adventures and their current projects on their website:
